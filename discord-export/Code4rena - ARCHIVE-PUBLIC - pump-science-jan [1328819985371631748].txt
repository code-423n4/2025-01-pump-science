No walkthrough of the code unfortunately. Check out the documentation and let me know if there’s any specific questions

what is meteora dynamic AMM? Is this the next step of Bonding Curve?


[01/17/2025 15:54] kulture_
Yes it’s an AMM on Solana and we create a liquidity pool on it

{Reactions}
👍 

[01/17/2025 15:58] tobi0x18
Oh, you mean, first you run your own x*y = k pool.
Then, when 85 sol is raised, remaining virtual token and Sol will be used to create a pool on Meteora (AMM on Solana), right?


[01/17/2025 16:20] kulture_
Yep


[01/17/2025 19:29] bount3yhunt3r_62669
@Kulture what is the solana version you are using?

solana-cli 1.18.15


[01/18/2025 03:51] kulture_
We're not doing that for now as we changed the 2 parameters for feeCalculation and we don't want to make any changes to the locked files in scope.

You can disregard those 2 failed tests for now

[01/18/2025 11:31] mahdirostami
hello, why should this test fail?

`creator try to create another bonding curve should fail`

`creator ` is using new `mintKp`.


[01/18/2025 11:32] kulture_
Because the creator was previously removed from whitelist while whitelist is still enabled

Kindly help me out, thanks.


[01/18/2025 15:25] kulture_
Seems like there's some rust related thing you need to install.

Perhaps cargo install cargo-build-sbf

Or the solana cli


[01/18/2025 15:31] owenzo
okay for the first command like the cargo install cargo-build-sbf its telling me that it doesnt exist.


[01/18/2025 15:38] owenzo
@Kulture I found out the solana-cli wasnt installed so I installed it but the command is still giving me issues

[01/25/2025 09:04] ihtishamsudo
In C4 app, but you need SR role


[01/27/2025 15:34] xkeywordx
why is the status not open? I mean, having the SR role in order to be allowed to comment in the app makes sense, but completely blocking users if they don't have the SR role seems like a poor design choice.


[01/27/2025 15:42] cloudellie
This is something we're considering, but historically C4 has only allowed SR wardens to have access to submissions prior to the report being published.


[01/27/2025 18:20] pascal9476
If I’m not mistaken SR role hasn’t been open in like 5 months now


[01/27/2025 18:23] cloudellie
Actively working on this, I know it's a major pain point


[01/27/2025 19:53] bount3yhunt3r_62669
@CloudEllie so if i submitted an issue without the SR role i can't see my status?


[01/27/2025 19:55] cloudellie
Correct. All the results are made public once the report is published. Until then, they’re visible to SR wardens only.


[01/27/2025 19:56] bount3yhunt3r_62669
how can i escalate then if i think i have a valid issue?


[01/27/2025 19:56] cloudellie
Escalation is also an SR privilege.


[01/27/2025 20:02] cloudellie
If you’d like to debate the rules, let’s not do it in this channel, which is meant for discussion specific to this audit. 

We’re always happy to have a conversation about how C4 can improve. #🐺・wardens is a good option.

so it was somehow "reverted"? I was just curious how it goes because I remember that the number of submissions here wasn't that big as compared to other contests

I recently reviewed the finalized report for the Pump Science contest and . I have noticed that the high-risk issue H-02 ("Missing Update of migration_token_allocation on Global Struct") identified in the final report appears to be the same as the issue I reported. However, my name and corresponding rewards are not reflected in the report.

For your reference, here are the relevant links:

My submission: https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-01-pump-science/submissions/S-146
Final report: https://code4rena.com/reports/2025-01-pump-science

I would appreciate it if you could review this matter and provide any necessary corrections.
